We <3 how technology and how it enables us to solve problems simply and intuitively. But this doesn't mean that the necessity or magic of physical products is lost on us.    

We believe in doing what you love (or _**dwyling**_ as the cool kids say) and _want to wear our hearts on our sleeves_ - sometimes literally.    
So we'll be making/having a few things made that will let us do just that and documenting our **decisions** and the **evolution of things** here.

[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/print-me/issues) _If you have any suggestions on how to improve these in future runs or think of anything cool we *should* be printing, let us know in the issues!_

##Stickers
###Why?
Pretty much everyone at dwyl loves stickers and hey, we couldn't let our friends down!

![@jrans-@nikhilaravi-@rjmk-and-their-sticker-filled-laptops](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4185328/8397354/6a1bffec-1dc0-11e5-8c3a-3c228f1fa0e6.jpg)

We encourage people to only take stickers if they have **longer term** uses in mind, such as sticking them on laptops or notebooks. What we _don't_ want is for people to stick them somewhere like on their clothes where they'll end up in landfill rather than being recycled with the product. We went with a non-laminate option.

###Where?
We needed these pretty quickly and turnarounds for most sticker suppliers seem to be between 10 and 20 days. We went with [Fast Print](http://www.fastprint.co.uk/adhesive-stickers-labels/gloss-stickers.html) for their quick turnaround of 4 days on custom stickers.

###Design
From the beginning we knew we wanted something very simple that centred on our icon (the heart-with-the-tick). We came up with [a few different yet basic designs](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/17) and none of them were _amazing_, but these are our **alpha stickers**.    

Whilst [@iteles](http://www.github.com/iteles) thought the final design was a bit too _bland_ with just one colour and all the uniformity, we **erred on the side of simplicity** for this initial small run.

They came on a few long sheets so there are a bit of DIY involved (which kind of made it fun)!

But we ended up with a decent end result:

###Changes
+ Further research needed into **most easily recycled/eco-friendly options**
+ The **colour wears off** these with some ease due to the lack of lamination - ties in with investigation into options above
+ Potentially get them **designed by someone with honed design skills** to add more interest whilst retaining the simplicity
+ **Hex stickers** of course! (thanks for [reminding us](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/17#issuecomment-116333887) [@iancrowther](http://www.github.com/iancrowther))
+ www.stickerapp.co.uk and www.diginate.com have been recommended to us.


##T-shirts
###Why?
We got a couple of t-shirts from our friends [@LiftSecurity](https://twitter.com/liftsecurity) and [@bithoundio](https://twitter.com/bithoundio) that were oh-so-soft and we [love showing them off](https://twitter.com/iteles/status/611945513424957440). As our wardrobes have to contain more than a 3 t-shirts, we thought it would be great to treat our [team](https://github.com/orgs/dwyl/teams/doers) to some dwyl tees too.

###Where?
We chose [Bella & Canvas](http://www.bellacanvas.com/about-us) t-shirts because whilst they're incredibly soft and come in some great colours, most importantly their [ethics are in the right place](http://www.bellacanvas.com/responsible-ts), both in terms of humans and the environment.    

Suppliers and printers of these tees were quite difficult to come by in the UK, but we went with [Fire Label](http://www.firelabel.co.uk/) for our small **alpha run** of 55 t-shirts. They have such a great attitude, we've been very impressed with how sunny and helpful they are.

###Design
//TODO link to all issues
https://github.com/dwyl/print-me/issues/1 - logo or app icon


###Changes
+ Investigate fairtrade and most eco friendly material in more detail (cotton is hugely water intensive for example, [bamboo is looking pretty appealing](http://bambooclothing.co.uk/good_for_the_environment.html)
+ Learn more about eco-friendly printing processes, [though this seems like a close call](https://rapanuiclothing.com/eco-friendly-screen-printing/)
+ //TODO design changes
